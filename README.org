* Good Company
If a page has benefitted you, show its graphics.
Else, block images on all other Pages.

All domains are not created equal. Some mean more to you than
others. To remind you of this, this (browser/web-) extension shows
media (images and videos) only on pages that you deem good
company. You can toggle this by clicking on the extension icon, or by
setting [[./meta/all.json][managed storage]].
