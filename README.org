* Good Company
If a page is Good Company (TM), show its graphics.

Else, block images on all other Pages.

All domains are not created equal. Some mean more to you than
others. To remind you of this, this browser/web-extension shows media
(images and videos) only on pages that you deem good company. You can do this by clicking on the extension icon, or by setting managed storage.
** Implementation
Simple css: img, video { hidden } on matching pages
